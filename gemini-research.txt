The US-China trade war, largely initiated during the Trump administration, involved a series of tariffs imposed by both countries on each other's goods. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Initial actions:** In 2018, the US, under President Trump, began imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, citing unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft, and the trade deficit. China retaliated with tariffs on US goods.
*   **Escalation:** The trade war escalated over several rounds, with tariffs being applied to increasing amounts of goods. By 2019, tariffs covered hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of imports from both countries.
*   **"Phase One" agreement:** In January 2020, the US and China signed a "Phase One" trade agreement, which included China's commitment to increase purchases of US goods and services, and some rollbacks of US tariffs. However, significant tariffs remained in place.
*   **Impacts:** The trade war had various impacts, including:

    *   **Economic effects:** It disrupted global supply chains, increased costs for businesses and consumers, and slowed economic growth in both countries and globally.
    *   **Political tensions:** It strained the relationship between the US and China, contributing to broader geopolitical tensions.
    *   **Winners and losers:** Some industries and countries benefited from the trade war as businesses sought alternative sources of supply.

While the Biden administration has maintained many of the tariffs put in place by the Trump administration, it has also sought to engage with China on trade issues through other means.
